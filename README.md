# Shopping App 
  This is an Open Sourced full stack E-Commerce App. I started this Project as my pet project to understand Retail business logic and then I started to get request to use this project from my friends and all round the world. So I decide to make it avialble for all who are starting a new business and having tough time build their own app. 

### What Is Included  :-

- Add any product to cart and update total item count and amount.
- Swipe to Dismiss along with Drag-Drop in Shopping List Fragments
- Swipe to dismiss in RecyclerView
- Store cart list in DB for persistant storage.
